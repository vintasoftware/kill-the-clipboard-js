- **Vitest** - Testing with coverage reports
- **Husky** - Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- **Semantic Release** - Automated versioning and releases
- **pnpm** - Fast package management with Corepack

## Setup

### 1. Use the template

Run this in your terminal _[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) required_

```bash
gh repo create my-typescript-library --clone --template neg4n/typescript-library-template --private && cd my-typescript-library
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `my-typescript-library` with your new library name, you can also change the visiblity of the newly created repo by passing `--public` instead of `--private`! Read more about possible options in [GitHub CLI documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create)

#### Setup via GitHub web interface

If for some reason you can't run the mentioned commands in your terminal, click the "Use this template ‚ñæ" button below (or in the top right corner of the repository page)

</a>


### 2. Minimal Setup

Run the initialization script to automatically configure your repository:

```bash
# One-command setup
./init.sh
```

This script will:
- üîí **Create repository rulesets** for branch protection (linear history, PR reviews)
- üö´ **Disable unnecessary features** (wikis, projects, squash/merge commits)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configure merge settings** (rebase-only workflow at repository and ruleset levels)
- üë§ **Grant admin bypass** permissions for repository administrators
- üîß **Verify GitHub Actions** and validate repository configuration
- üîë **Check required secrets** and provide setup instructions

### 3. Required Secrets

The script will guide you to set up these secrets if missing:

**NPM_TOKEN** (for publishing):
```bash
# Generate NPM token with OTP for enhanced security
pnpm token create --otp=<YOUR_OTP> --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Set the token as repository secret
gh secret set NPM_TOKEN --body "your-npm-token-here"
```

**ACTIONS_BRANCH_PROTECTION_BYPASS** (for automated releases):
```bash
# Create Personal Access Token with 'repo' permissions
# Visit: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new

# Set the PAT as repository secret
gh secret set ACTIONS_BRANCH_PROTECTION_BYPASS --body "your-pat-token-here"
```

## FAQ

#### How do I modify the merging methods?

`typescript-library-template` sets **rebase-only** at both repository and main branch levels. Here's how to modify this:

##### **Current Setup**
- **Repository**: Rebase merging only (squash/merge disabled)
- **Main branch ruleset**: Requires rebase merging

##### **To Change Merge Methods**

**For repository-wide changes:**
- **Settings > General > Pull Requests** - toggle merge methods

**For branch-specific changes:**
- **Settings > Rules** - edit the main branch ruleset's "Require merge type"

##### **Precedence Rules**
1. Repository settings define what's **available**
2. Rulesets add **restrictions** on top  
3. **Most restrictive wins** - if repository disallows a method but ruleset requires it, merging is **blocked**

##### **Common Modifications**
- **Allow all methods**: Enable squash/merge in repo settings + remove "Require merge type" from ruleset
- **Squash-only**: Change repo settings to squash-only OR keep current repo settings + change ruleset to require squash
- **Different rules per branch**: Create additional rulesets for other branch patterns

> [!TIP]
> Since `typescript-library-template` is rebase-only, you must enable other methods in repository settings before rulesets can use them.

#### How to solve pnpm lockfile error on my CI/CD?

If you're seeing this error in your CI/CD (GitHub Actions) pipeline:

```
[...]

ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with <ROOT>/package.json

[...]
```

##### **Why This Happens**
This template uses `--frozen-lockfile` flag to ensure consistent installations in CI/CD. The error occurs when your `package.json` has been modified but the `pnpm-lock.yaml` hasn't been updated to match.

##### **Solution**
Run the following command locally:
```bash
pnpm install
```

This will:
1. Update your `pnpm-lock.yaml` to match your `package.json`
2. Install any new dependencies
3. Resolve version conflicts

Then commit the updated lockfile:
```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pnpm lockfile"
```

> [!TIP]
> This is expected behavior and ensures your CI/CD uses the exact same dependency versions as your local environment.

#### Why Linear History?

Linear history provides several benefits for library releases:

- **Clean commit history** - Easy to track changes and debug issues
- **Simplified releases** - Semantic release works better with linear commits
- **Clear changelog** - Each commit represents a complete change
- **Better debugging** - `git bisect` works more effectively
- **Consistent workflow** - Forces proper PR review process
